Crowddynamics is a simulation environment written in Python package for simulation movement of crowds. Project was created in summer 2016 for Systems Analysis Laboratory (SAL) in Aalto University in Finland. More about the project can be read from the project's documentation_.

Real life applications for crowd research and crowd dynamics are

* Improving safety of buildings, mass events and crowded places in general.
* Evacuation time estimation and understanding evacuation processes
* Venue design and improving the flow rates of the crowd in critical parts, subways for example.
* Producing realistic movement in games, animations and virtual reality
